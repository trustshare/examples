## 📖 Introduction

The system allows you to take control of projects by creating them up front. These are known as 'controlled' project. This example shows how a controlled project can be used to define a payment flow with multiple participants all paying into the same project.

Controlled project are very powerful and unlock many different flows. For example, you could issue a Project for a repeat buyer on your system so they have a consistent set of account credentials to pay into.
